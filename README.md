This is another todo list. 
I am following along with the tutorial to brush up on my react knowledge as well as see another way to do the same thing. This is to aid in my creation of a bigger project.

### 
After completing this tutorial I really liked how simple and straight forward it was.
Next I need to create one that has an ability for me to save it and be able to access it anytime, not loose with a refresh.
My goal is to have one that I can have multiple pages of todos/checklists.


Here is the link to the video in case I or anyone who is looking at this would like to view the tutorial.
